# Full Snack System

This is a frontend architecture study from Maxi Ferreira at https://frontendatscale.com/courses/frontend-architecture

I'll use this folder to put all diagrams made during the course


## Containers Diagram

### Version 1 (first try)

### Version 2 (from course)
![container-diagram-v2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34344896-e0b4-4d0e-82e3-4ebfe2b7049a)

Version 2 updates include:
- Actors that use the system (Consumer, Restaurant, Driver)
- A box indicating what is part of the system and what is not
- A box to group the web and mobile apps to clean the diagram (instead of arrowing each app)
- Integration between web sockets and apps with the Core API
- Better description for the arrow links
